The job of a Data Scientist was called by the Harvard Business Review “the sexiest job of the 21st century” Data Scientists are individuals with a curiosity to look through data, identify patterns and develop testable hypotheses. In Biological Sciences, data scientists dig through data to answer questions about health, disease, evolution, ecology, drug development, and much more. A currently relevant example is compiling and looking at the similarities and differences between the different SARS-CoV-2 strains and identify differences between strains that may lead to differences in rates of infection. 1.0.2 What is C-MOOR? C-MOOR is a project to invite students to join the data science revolution and be part of the next generation of data scientists. This project provides online materials to help students and instructors incorporate authentic research experiences in lower division courses.

RStudio will also cost $0.01 per hour while paused and not in use. Additionally, the persistent storage the environment comes with (50GB) costs $2.00 per month if not deleted. To minimize costs, we ask students to delete their RStudio Environment and persistent disk at the end of every session. While you can also reduce the amount of CPUs and memory allotted per session this will also slow down your computation. We will not go over setting up a Google billing account which you will need to setting up a billing project on AnVIL. For assistance with setting up your billing account we suggest refering to the Terra (the platform on which AnVIL runs) guide to billing and speaking with your institution’s information technology and finance departments. 2.6.0.1 Purpose We will learn about the billing structure of AnVIL and how to attach users to billing projects. We will then cover how to create groups on AnVIL which you may find helpful in organizing billing. 2.6.0.2 Learning Objectives Distinguish between a billing account and a billing project Understand how billing projects are connected to workspaces Add users to a billing project Learn how to create groups that can be used to control users’ access 2.6.1 What is a billing project? A billing project is used to connect a workspace - where students will be executing code - to a billing account, which is where your actual payment information is stored. As you can see in the above diagram, a billing account can have multiple billing projects, and each billing project can be used by multiple workspaces. We suggest each student uses their own workspace and attaching all those workspaces to a billing project for the class. Currently, AnVIL only allow you to monitor costs from billing projects, not workspaces. But having different billing projects shown above for each class can help you learn how much computational resources reach class is using. 2.6.2 Adding students to a billing account Follow the written steps below or refer to the slides or video guide. Access billing by clicking on the hamburger icon in the top left corner of the window, click on your name, and select billing. That brings you to your billing projects page. On the billing project you’d like to use, click on the Members tab. Click Add users. A new window will open. You are then able to add students to the billing project with the same email they used to sign up for their AnVIL account. 2.6.3 Using groups to manage classes If you have a lot of students and classes, you may find it helpful to organize your students with groups. Everyone in the group is controlled by a single email address. Access billing by clicking on the hamburger icon in the top left corner of the window, click on your name, and select groups. This will take you to this groups page. Click Create New group. You will be prompted to give your group a unique name. Click on the name of the newly created group to enter it. Click add users. Add users to the group using the same email they used to sign up for AnVIL. You can use the group email created for the group seen on the group management page to manage everyone in that group. For example, you can add everyone in the group to a billing project by adding this group email to the billing project. 2.6.4 Preventing runaway costs Our team at C-MOOR is still piloting our curriculum on AnVIL. As such, we don’t have much information on the approximate cost per student. We hope to provide this data in the future. The best way to conserve costs is to make sure that students close out their session on AnVIL properly, including the deletion of the persistent disk after they are done working. AnVIL will continue to bill the billing project even if the environment is not in active use. For more information on how to control computing charges, please see the Terra guide: How to cut off GCP charges. 2.6.4.1 Footnotes 2.6.4.2 Contributions and Affiliations Sayumi York, Notre Dame University of Maryland Last Revised: July 24, 2025 "],["running-a-module-on-anvil.html", "2.7 Running a module on AnVIL", " 2.7 Running a module on AnVIL 2.7.0.1 Purpose In this section we will go over how to run C-MOOR modules on AnVIL. First we will need to clone the workspace that correlates to the research project we want to do (RNA-seq or 16S). We will only need to do this step once. Then we will go over how to create an RStudio environment in that workspace to run the module and properly end a session on AnVIL to prevent runaway costs. 2.7.0.2 Learning Objectives Clone a public workspace for the research project you want to do (RNA-seq or 16S) Launch a module through the cloned workspace Close out a session on AnVIL properly to prevent runaway costs 2.7.1 What is a workspace? The workspace is the heart of AnVIL. Here are some key points about workspaces: Every workspace comes with its own Google Bucket (our cloud storage). Your bucket will be empty. Every workspace has its own billing project. Students who are not yet associated with a billing project will not be able to compute on their workspace. We can control access levels of users and set them either as owners, writers, or readers. Students will be writers with compute access. 2.7.2 Clone a workspace on AnVIL We only have to do this once.

In this assignment you will learn how to set up a “compute container” on SciServer. Compute containers are how you use programs on SciServer. There are two C-MOOR compute containers on SciServer: “C-MOOR LearnR” has tutorials that will teach you how to run data analyses, and “C-MOOR R-Studio” is where you can work on your own data analysis projects. This assignment shows you how to set up the C-MOOR LearnR compute container and start up your first tutorial. 3.2.1 Start up a “C-MOOR LearnR” compute container This video (video)(slides) shows you how to create and start up a C-MOOR LearnR compute container. You can follow along with the video, or follow the steps below. Open sciserver.org in a web browser and log in to your account. If you are already logged in, click “Home” in the top menu to return to the home page. Scroll down to the second set of boxes and click “Compute” Click “Create container” Give your container a name. This can be anything you like, but it’s useful if it says something about the purpose of the container so you can tell your containers apart. You could name this container “Tutorials”, since you’ll be using it to access tutorials. In the “Compute Image” drop-down menu, select the “C-MOOR LearnR that your instructor chooses” Under “Data Volumes”, check the box next to “C-MOOR Data” Click “Create”. This may take a moment. You should now see a new entry in your list of containers “Created At” should be a few moments ago. “Name” should be the name you chose “Image” should be “C-MOOR LearnR” Start your C-MOOR LearnR container by clicking on its name (whatever name you chose when you created it). This will open in a new tab. You should see a list of tutorials, organized by topic. If instead you see an error message, you most likely forgot to check the box next to “C-MOOR Data” when you created the container. If you see something else, you may have picked the wrong “Compute Image” from the drop-down menu. If anything goes wrong, you can always delete your container by clicking the red “X” in the last column, and create a new container. 3.2.2 Opening C-MOOR modules If you’re not there already, go to the SciServer compute page and start up the C-MOOR LearnR container. Open sciserver.org in a web browser and log in to your account. If you are already logged in, click “Home” in the top menu to return to the home page. Scroll down to the second set of boxes and click “Compute”. Start your C-MOOR LearnR container by clicking on its name. Click on the module chosen by your instructor. The tutorial will open in a new tab. Complete the tutorial. 3.2.3 Delete your C-MOOR LearnR compute container Compute containers are meant to be temporary, and you can only have 3 containers total on SciServer. So it’s generally a good idea to clean up after yourself and delete your containers when you’re done using them. Also, if any updates are made to the C-MOOR LearnR container, you will need to create a new container to get the latest updates. Deleting your container will delete your progress in a tutorial, so don’t delete the container until you have completed the tutorial and submitted any required items to your instructor. To delete a container: If you’re not there already, go to the SciServer compute page. Open sciserver.org in a web browser and log in to your account. If you are already logged in, click “Home” in the top menu to return to the home page. Scroll down to the second set of boxes and click “Compute”. Find the container you want to delete.

We suggest giving students time to sign up well in advance of their first module on SciServer in case of technical difficulties. "],["running-modules-on-sciserver-1.html", "6.2 Running modules on SciServer", " 6.2 Running modules on SciServer 6.2.0.1 Purpose The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to access the modules for your course on SciServer and properly close out your session when finished. 6.2.0.2 Learning Objectives Start up a C-MOOR LearnR compute container Access a C-MOOR module Delete your C-MOOR LearnR compute container when finished Before beginning this assignment, you should have already created a SciServer account and submitted your SciServer username to your instructor. In this assignment you will learn how to set up a “compute container” on SciServer. Compute containers are how you use programs on SciServer. There are two C-MOOR compute containers on SciServer: “C-MOOR LearnR” has tutorials that will teach you how to run data analyses, and “C-MOOR R-Studio” is where you can work on your own data analysis projects. This assignment shows you how to set up the C-MOOR LearnR compute container and start up your first tutorial. 6.2.1 Start up a “C-MOOR LearnR” compute container This video (video)(slides) shows you how to create and start up a C-MOOR LearnR compute container. You can follow along with the video, or follow the steps below. Open sciserver.org in a web browser and log in to your account. If you are already logged in, click “Home” in the top menu to return to the home page. Scroll down to the second set of boxes and click “Compute” Click “Create container” Give your container a name. This can be anything you like, but it’s useful if it says something about the purpose of the container so you can tell your containers apart. You could name this container “Tutorials”, since you’ll be using it to access tutorials. In the “Compute Image” drop-down menu, select the “C-MOOR LearnR that your instructor chooses” Under “Data Volumes”, check the box next to “C-MOOR Data” Click “Create”. This may take a moment. You should now see a new entry in your list of containers “Created At” should be a few moments ago. “Name” should be the name you chose “Image” should be “C-MOOR LearnR” Start your C-MOOR LearnR container by clicking on its name (whatever name you chose when you created it). This will open in a new tab. You should see a list of tutorials, organized by topic. If instead you see an error message, you most likely forgot to check the box next to “C-MOOR Data” when you created the container. If you see something else, you may have picked the wrong “Compute Image” from the drop-down menu. If anything goes wrong, you can always delete your container by clicking the red “X” in the last column, and create a new container. 6.2.2 Opening C-MOOR modules If you’re not there already, go to the SciServer compute page and start up the C-MOOR LearnR container. Open sciserver.org in a web browser and log in to your account. If you are already logged in, click “Home” in the top menu to return to the home page. Scroll down to the second set of boxes and click “Compute”. Start your C-MOOR LearnR container by clicking on its name. Click on the module chosen by your instructor. The tutorial will open in a new tab. Complete the tutorial. 6.2.3 Delete your C-MOOR LearnR compute container Compute containers are meant to be temporary, and you can only have 3 containers total on SciServer. So it’s generally a good idea to clean up after yourself and delete your containers when you’re done using them. Also, if any updates are made to the C-MOOR LearnR container, you will need to create a new container to get the latest updates. Deleting your container will delete your progress in a tutorial, so don’t delete the container until you have completed the tutorial and submitted any required items to your instructor. To delete a container: If you’re not there already, go to the SciServer compute page. Open sciserver.org in a web browser and log in to your account. If you are already logged in, click “Home” in the top menu to return to the home page. Scroll down to the second set of boxes and click “Compute”. Find the container you want to delete. Click on the red “X” in the last column. 6.2.3.1 Footnotes 6.2.3.2 Resources sciserver.org Get help with SciServer on the C-MOOR Discourse 6.2.3.3 Contributions and Affiliations Katherine Cox, Johns Hopkins University Frederick Tan, Carnegie Institution Last Revised: May 13, 2021 "],["scientific-posters.html", "Chapter 7 Scientific Posters", " Chapter 7 Scientific Posters In this section we will go over how to create a scientific poster. We chose a poster as our final deliverable in C-MOOR because they: Facilitate participation in research symposiums: Students can use their poster to apply to present at research symposiums or conferences with minimal additional effort beyond what they do in class. If your institution does not have a research day, consider starting one using these posters as a foundation as we did at Clovis Community College! Your school’s library is another great point of contact in getting a poster session or research day set up. Some of the events students have participated in using their C-MOOR projects include: The Clovis Community College Research Day The Notre Dame of Maryland University Research Day The GRADS-4C Conference (2025) Serve as a physical representation of student achievement: If printed, once finished with the class, students can choose to take their poster with them or leave it with the class to be hung up around the classroom or the hallways. This gives their research project more visibility, serves as an advertisement for other students who might be interested in taking the class, and showcases what students have accomplished. Can easily be shared digitally: A presentation can’t be repeated twice without a recording, and each recording can take up a lot of digital storage. A poster on the other hand, is a great compressed product that can be posted on a student’s (or the institution’s) social media and help get their work seen by others. Posters are even small enough that they can be attached to an email and sent to prospective supervisors and collaborators interested in a quick summary of their work. See our Look at This! category on the C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum to see all the posters students have created and shared so far! Posters can be used to measure student achievement and understanding: We have previously used these posters to evaluate student learning, even years after students have left the classroom.

Poster is a powerful visual way to communicate new and exciting findings, share ideas and get feedback. No wonder Poster sessions are an integral part of any conference or symposium. Throughout research project work, students will work with their groups to put together a scientific research poster. 7.3.2 Part 1 - Choose a Template Estimated time: 5 minutes With your group, open a suggested poster template to use for your poster. Discuss with your group how you will divide up the work and exchange important information (e.g. phone numbers, email). Consider the following sections: Abstract Introduction Methods Results Conclusions/Discussion References Acknowledgments Not every poster has every section. Refer to your instructor and their rubric on what to include in your poster. Notice these posters are sized at 36 x 42 inches, but there are many other commonly used sizes. Refer to your instructor on what poster size to use; not every poster will fit every stand when printed (if applicable). Notice that the posters in this slidedeck come in two-column, three-column, and mixed formats. Think about your figures and tables and select a format that makes the most sense for them. There are also some example posters in the last two slides that we will use to examine the anatomy of a research poster further in the next part. 7.3.3 Part 2 - Make an Academic Research Poster Estimated time: — Complete the following components of your research poster with your group. You might not do them in this order, but these are the components you are being graded on. For more details on each of these sections and their role in a scientific paper, see the Scientific Literature Lab. 7.3.3.1 The header: title, authors, and affiliations Since you completed this work as a team of scientists, all of your team members are considered authors. List your team members in alphabetical order. The author’s affiliation is the university, college, research institution or company that the work was conducted at. An example affiliation for Clovis Community College would be: “Department of Biology, Clovis Community College, California, United States.” If multiple institutions exist, you will need to use superscript to denote who has what affiliation (see the example poster). We will include the C-MOOR logo, the logo of your institution(s), and the most immediately relevant funding source (if applicable) in the header. 7.3.3.2 Abstract C-MOOR Abstract examples: PacBio’s published abstract on ‘Genome-resolved metagenome assembly of human oral microbiome using highly accurate long-read sequencing’. An abstract is a concise summary of your research project from start to finish. An effective abstract will inform the reader of the relevant background to the research, the scientific hypothesis being tested, the purpose of the study, the main methods, and the most important results and conclusions. The abstract can be difficult to write because it combines all sections from your research and requires effective and concise communication of those sections. Many scientists choose to write the abstract last, after they fully understand the conclusions and implications of their work. Identify your scientific question, your hypothesis, and the knowledge gap (the unknown your research is addressing) first. Then brainstorm what you will need to tell your readers in terms of context and background. Your abstract should do the following: Include relevant background information such as*: - The model organism - The relevant phenotypes (ex. disease-state) - The gene of interest and its function - The known connection between the microbiome or gene and the phenotype - Relevant biological processes (ex. pathways) Clearly state hypothesis, aims, and/or objectives of the research: - e.g. Our hypothesis is that the healthy gut microbiome has more microbial diversity than the gut of an individual with a celiac disease.` - e.g. We hypothesize that maternal antibiotic treatment correlates with higher antibicrobial resistance in infant microbiome.` Briefly mention methodology you used in your research - e.g. Using Galaxy we analyzed the genomic diversity of the gut microbiome and compared fecal samples between individuals with Celiac Disease (CD) and a control group on a healthy diet without CD.` - e.g. We analyzed a publically available dataset comparing RNA-seq gene expression data between the left and right eyes in DESeq2.&quot; Summarize the main results of your study and how they relate to the hypothesis/aims/objectives you outlined earlier - e.g. We found that gene X was differentially abundant between the eye and all other tissues, suggesting gene X plays an important role in the eye. This may be important for learning more about eye development and X condition.` - e.g. We found an association between age and the presence of Y bacteria, which supports our hypothesis that Y bacteria is involved in the disease state` 7.3.3.3 Introduction Introductions can be highly variable. Sometimes they contain the same information as the abstract under a different name. At other times, the introduction only contains the relevant information needed to understand the study and the study’s hypothesis/aims/objectives and does not include the methodology, results, or takeaways from the study. In these cases, the introduction can go into more detail in comparision to an abstract. 7.3.3.4 Materials and Methods The materials and methods section will detail your analysis of the data. Don’t provide any of your results, just the methods. If you did not generate the data yourself from raw samples, you will simply cite the paper that made them instead of detailing their construction. We will also need to list any programs we used and provide credit to their creators. Some other things you might include would be what type of analysis you decided to do (which parts of the body parts you analyzed, sets of genes, what p-value you used, etc.). 7.3.3.5 Results The Results section is where you will detail your data primarily through figures and tables, though sometimes written text is included. Begin by creating your tables and figures. Figure body: Has high resolution images, well spaced and labeled parts and text. Place the figures and tables in order of how you want to present them and name them such as Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1, Table 2, etc. Figure/table Legends: Figures have their legends underneath them. Tables have their legends above them. The legend should be in a smaller font than the main text on the poster. A legend should includes a bolded figure title, which is a declarative statement that summarizes findings. A legend also includes figure text which a) identifies (and can briefly describe parts), b) includes brief description of of methods necessary to understand figure and c) should include relevant statistics (stats). Optional components: Bullet pointed text that summarizes the main findings of the figures/tables and references them (ex. We found result X (Fig 1)) A more informative section header which summarizes the main figure(s) instead of a generic “Results” header 7.3.3.6 Conclusions/Discussion The conclusion/discussion section of the paper is your chance to analyze and interpret your results. A discussion generally addresses the following: What do your results mean? How do they fit into the bigger picture? If any experiments did not give your expected results, hypothesize why that might have been the case and propose alternate experiments that could confirm or clarify your results Include at least one sentence of future work that you would do if you had more time or what students in upcoming semesters could do to continue to answer your questions 7.3.3.7 References All the references that you cite on your poster must be present in a References section including the following sections: Introduction, Methods, and Discussion. To save space on our posters, we will number our references (ex. 1-5) and use the numbers as citations throughout the text of your poster. You may have a lot of references; it is okay to put them in tiny text if you have to in order to make them fit. There are many different ways to format the reference section. We will make ours in alphabetical order by the first author’s last name. All of your sources must be scientific journals and should use the following format: Authors (year) “Title.” Journal Name, vol. #, page #s, DOI Online article that is also in print: Haussecker D., Huang Y., Lau A., Parameswaran P., Fire A. Z. and M. A. Kay (2010) “Human tRNA-derived small RNAs in the global regulation of RNA silencing.” RNA, Vol. 16, page 637-695, doi:10.1261/rna.2000810 Online article only: Marianes, A. and A. C. Spradling (2013) “Physiological and stem cell compartmentalization within the Drosophila midgut.” eLife, doi:10.7554/eLife.00886 7.3.3.8 Acknowledgements The acknowledgements section is where you give thanks to the people, organizations, and institutions that have supported you in your research. If relevant, include the grant ID # of your funding source. Institutions and organizations that have contributed to your research - but you do not belong to - can be thanked here. 7.3.4 Part 3 - Proofread and Add Final Touches Estimated time: 30 min to an hour Each group member should re-read the poster from beginning to end and fix any typos or grammatical errors. Check the alignment of figures, text boxes, titles, etc. Add some finishing touches. You can play with the color, the font, add additional images if it’s relevant. 7.3.5 Part 4 - Canvas Discussion Estimated time: 30 min You will turn in your poster to be graded as a group in a Canvas Assignment and post it to a Canvas Discussion to be viewed by the class. Convert your poster to a pdf. Have one member of your group turn in the pdf of your poster to the Graded Canvas Assignment. This assignment is already set up so that if one group member turns it in, it will show as submitted for all students in the group. This is where your instructor will grade you poster as a group. Have one member of your group post a pdf of your poster in the Canvas C-MOOR Poster Discussion. With your poster, introduce your group members and copy and paste your abstract into the post. Insert your pdf into the post and edit the link so that it automatically shows the inline preview. This will make it easier for students to view your poster. As an individual, read through the other posters from different groups. Post comments 7.3.6 Grading Criteria Your instructor will provide for you a rubric specific to your class.

We advise you and your students to do this as soon as possible after the end of class while your research project is still on your mind. 8.3.1 Resume or CV? You may hear the terms resume and CV being used interchangeably. While both are drawn from the same information, they vary in brevity and focus. A resume is a one-page (sometimes two-page) document of your experiences generally used for jobs outside of academia and research labs. It’s not uncommon for people to have more than one resume, as it’s best to tailor every resume to each specific role you’re applying to. A Curriculum Vitae (CV) is an extensive document that can take as many pages as needed to list the entirety of your research and academic experience. It often includes sections that aren’t found in non-academic fields such as publications, conferences, and published papers. Most positions will detail which they require from applicants and most colleges and universities will be able to help you build either at your library or career center. We suggest that current students and recent graduates interested add their C-MOOR research experience to either their classwork or projects section. Remember to acknowledge the contributions of your team members if applicable; this does not count against you in your applications! Here are some examples of how you might word your experiences; notice how they’re similar to an abstract in just one or two sentences: An RNA-seq project: Along with a partner, examined differential expression data of the period (per) gene along the Drosophila melanogaster midgut from a published dataset (Marianes &amp; Spradling 2013) using DESeq2 and ClusterProfiler. We discovered an elevated expression of per in the anterior region of the midgut where the primary digestion and absorption of carbohydrates occur. Our results were presented as a research poster at the 2025 Kuntz Research Day symposium and have implications for using Drosophila as a model for the connection between the circadian rhythm and metabolic disorders. A 16S project: My group and I profiled the abundance of Archean ASVs in the gut microbiome from a published 16S study comparing the gut microbiota of people before, during, and after a standardized diet (Guthrie et al. 2022). As a part of this study, we created a PCoA and performed an alpha diversity analysis in phyloseq. Archean community members are often overlooked in microbiome studies; we found differential abundance in Methanobacteria between male and female participants regardless of diet and hypothesize this may be due to consumption of fiber reported by male subjects pre- and post-diet. A WGS project: Public data (SRA#######) from Robinson et al. (2021) was analyzed in Galaxy using Trimmomatic, Megahit, and Krona to determine the viral abundance in samples from tap water from various North American Lakes and make comparisons to lake depth. Viral abundance was correlated with geographic distance between samples; future studies could examine if this pattern persists in samples sourced from Europe and Oceana. Your blurb is a strong blurb when:   You credit the source of your data (Citation, SRA #, Project #)   You describe why your research project matters   You list some of the computational platforms or software you used Q: Will people think I am an expert in genomics and bioinformatics if I put my project on my resume/CV? I don’t want to look like a phony. A: As a current student or new graduate, you are not expected to have mastery over any scientific domain. What you are trying to show is you have taken an idea and brought it to completion, your ability to learn new concepts and skills, and your previous exposure to research. You can explain more about your role in the project in an interview. Q: Can I list things like R or Galaxy in my skills section? A: You can, however we suggest being explicit in your experience and add the level at which you feel comfortable with each respective platform. Are you R (Beginner) or R (Proficient)? Can you teach someone else how to do your project? Can you perform your project with novel data? How good are you at troubleshooting? This answer may seem contrary to the previous one, but remember that other people who are listing these platforms in their skills section includes computer/data scientists (majors) and bioinformaticians (majors), so people may assume mastery. Think about it the same way you would a foreign language. Spanish (Beginner) describes a different level of skill than ‘just’ Spanish.

Maybe you’re more interested in wet lab work, or a specific model organism. We encourage you to try all sorts of different opportunities even if you feel totally comfortable working with C-MOOR so you can better understand what kind of roles suit you best. This section serves as a guide for some common jumping off points to find outside research opportunities. 8.5.1 Research opportunities at your institution Many colleges and universities have research programs for their students or resources available to connect you to some. You can ask your instructor, adviser, or library for more information. Some popular programs include: Undergraduate Research Opportunity Programs (UROP): Which often provide a database or pipeline of research opportunities for students at the univeristy or from surrounding areas. Research experiences for undergraduates (REU): Similar to UROP, but generally open for a wider audience of students from outside the community. See the NSF REU website for more information. Opportunities come and go and often follow the academic-year in terms of availability. If you can’t find something immediately, keep trying! 8.5.2 Find a research lab to join You can choose to pursue additional research opportunities in what we consider the more traditional way: by reaching out to a professor or research scientist whose work you are interested in and asking if they might be willing to have you in their lab. As these opportunities are at the discretion of the lab leader they will vary widely in their scope, duration, and ability to provide financial support. An email to a potential research lab should contain:  An introduction about yourself (name, class year, institution, major)  1-2 sentences about your previous experience in research  1-2 sentences about why you’re interested in their lab specifically  A polite, open ended request to work with them Dear Professor Penguin, My name is Student, and I am a junior at My University majoring in biology (or other). I read your chapter on the genetics yellow-eyed penguins in Penguins: Natural history and conservation, and then checked out your profile on the University website. My interests are broadly defined in environmental toxicology and I am interested in the work you are doing using eDNA and studies on the effects of plastic on developing penguin transcriptomes. I previously completed a project as a part of an RNA-seq miniCURE and have some exposure to working with DESeq2, though I still have much to learn. My group and I profiled the gene expression of the genes XYZ in the Drosophila midugt and I presented our poster at our university’s research day poster session. Thank you for your time and consideration in reading my email. Please let me know if you are currently available to mentor an undergraduate in your lab and if you would be willing to have me as a potential student. I hope to hear from you soon! Don’t be surprised if it takes the researcher a while to get back to you or if they respond curtly. They likely get many requests and are very busy. Continue to reach out to labs and apply to programs; it is difficult to know when opportunities are available as funding fluctuates. "],["biodigs.html", "8.6 BioDIGS", " 8.6 BioDIGS This section is primarily geared toward instructors as students will be able to get access to the BioDIGS data through their local C-MOOR Scholars chapter. What is BioDIGS?: BioDIGS is a project from the Genomic Data Science Community Network (GDSCN), which aims to characterize the microbiome of soil throughout sites in the US while connecting scientists to research. What makes BioDIGS different?: Soil is hypothesized to be the most diverse system on our planet, and BioDIGS is gathering sequence data and matching environmental data to elucidate the connection of soil microbes to abiotic variables and human health. Students at participating sites can take the entire project from soil sampling all the way through computational analysis. Curricula and more information on how to get a soil sampling kit are available on the BioDIGS website.
