The job of a Data Scientist was called by the Harvard Business Review “the sexiest job of the 21st century” Data Scientists are individuals with a curiosity to look through data, identify patterns and develop testable hypotheses. In Biological Sciences, data scientists dig through data to answer questions about health, disease, evolution, ecology, drug development, and much more. A currently relevant example is compiling and looking at the similarities and differences between the different SARS-CoV-2 strains and identify differences between strains that may lead to differences in rates of infection. 1.0.2 What is C-MOOR? C-MOOR is a project to invite students to join the data science revolution and be part of the next generation of data scientists. This project provides online materials to help students and instructors incorporate authentic research experiences in lower division courses.

The purpose of this assignment is to register for an AnVIL account, and clone the workspace appropriate for your class and research project 2.1.2 Learning Objectives Create an account on AnVIL Share your email address with your instructor Clone the workspace for your specific research project 2.1.3 Introduction AnVIL (The Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space) is a platform created by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) in collaboration with cloud computing platform providers like Google and Microsoft. Using AnVIL we you can access computing resources on the cloud through your browser without need for any fancy physical equipment. Through AnVIL you will also have access to all the software and data necessary to complete your research project. 2.1.4 Instructions 2.1.4.1 Create an account on AnVIL This video (video)(slides) show you how to create an AnVIL account, clone a workspace, run a module, and then close down your environment. 2.1.4.1.1 Sign up for an account on AnVIL Open anvil.terra.bio in Google Chrome . Google Chrome is the only officially supported web browser for AnIVL. It is a good idea to bookmark this page so that you can easily access it throughout the course. Click the hamburger icon (3 horizontal lines) in the top left corner of the screen Click “Sign in” Click “Sign in with Google”. Sign in with a Google associated email address such as an institutional email that uses Gmail or a personal Gmail account. You must use a Google associated email address to gain access to Google Cloud computing resources. Follow all steps required to complete creating an account (ex. email verification of account) Share the email you used to sign up for AnVIL with your instructor. Your instructor will add you to a billing project that will allow you to use computational resources on AnVIL. Until they do so, you will not be able to compute anything. 2.1.4.1.2 Clone a workspace on AnVIL While logged into AnVIL, using the hamburger icon in the top left corner of the screen, navigate to the workspaces page Select the public tab Search for the desired workspace. Your instructor will tell you which workspace to look for (miniCURE-RNA-seq or miniCURE-16S-Human_Gut). Click on the more options icon on the right side of the desired workspace and click clone Give the cloned workspace a unique name, such as by adding your initials or last name. All workspaces must have unique names; if someone has already taken the workspace name you initially wanted, please try a different name. Confirm the billing project is the one your instructor has chosen. The rest of the options should be left as is. Clone the workspace. It may take a few minutes to clone. You only have to clone the workspace once. From now on, use your cloned workspace. After you clone the workspace you will automatically be directed to it. For all other times, your workspaces can be found using the hamburger icon in the top left. 2.1.4.1.3 Running modules on AnVIL When you open the workspace, you will be on the dashboard tab by default. The dashboard contains the instructions on how to use the workspace, links to C-MOOR websites, and the startup script. Copy the startup script. Make sure there are no spaces before or after what you copy. This script is held in the original workspace everyone cloned. It does not have to be in your own workspace for it to work. Click on the Environment Configuration button (cloud with thunderbolt) In the RStudio section, click Settings In application configuration, select Legacy RStudio (R 4.4.1, Bioconductor 3.19, Python 3.10.12). In the startup script field, paste the startup script Scroll to the bottom of the window and click “Create”. It will take some time for the RStudio Environment to be created. You can keep track of the status of the environment based on the colored dot next to the RStudio icon. The dot will turn green when the environment is ready. While it is loading (blue), you cannot interact with it. When the environment is ready, use the Open RStudio button that will pop up. You can also access RStudio through the Analyses tab. If you hold down Ctrl as you click, you can open RStudio in a new window. Use the file explorer in RStudio to navigate to your module of choice. From the folder called cure-rnaseq, go to tutorials, and then the folder of the module you want. In the module’s directory, open the .Rmd file by double clicking its name.

In this assignment you will learn how to set up a “compute container” on SciServer. Compute containers are how you use programs on SciServer. There are two C-MOOR compute containers on SciServer: “C-MOOR LearnR” has tutorials that will teach you how to run data analyses, and “C-MOOR R-Studio” is where you can work on your own data analysis projects. This assignment shows you how to set up the C-MOOR LearnR compute container and start up your first tutorial. 2.3.4 Instructions 2.3.4.1 Accept invitation to join class SciServer group This video (video)(slides) shows you how to join a SciServer group. You can follow along with the video, or follow the steps below. Open sciserver.org in a web browser and log in to your account. Click “Groups” On the left, you should see a list of all the groups you have joined or been invited to. Click on the name of the group for this course, then click “Accept invitation”. Your instructor must have your username to invite you to the group. If you do not see an invitation, contact your instructor with your SciServer username. Confirm that you can access course data On the top menu bar, click “Files” On the left-hand menu, click “Data Volumes” Confirm that you see “C-MOOR-Data” Confirm that you can access course computing resources Click “Home” in the top menu to return to the home page. Scroll down to the second set of boxes and click “Compute” Click “Create container” In the “Compute Image” drop-down menu, confirm that you can see “C-MOOR LearnR” and “C-MOOR R-Studio” Under “Data Volumes”, confirm that you can see “C-MOOR Data” You can close the Create Container dialog box (by clicking the “X” in the top right) once you’ve confirmed that you can see the C-MOOR content 2.3.4.1.1 Resources sciserver.org Get help with SciServer on the C-MOOR Discourse 2.3.4.2 Start up a “C-MOOR LearnR” compute container This video (video)(slides) shows you how to create and start up a C-MOOR LearnR compute container. You can follow along with the video, or follow the steps below. Open sciserver.org in a web browser and log in to your account. If you are already logged in, click “Home” in the top menu to return to the home page. Scroll down to the second set of boxes and click “Compute” Click “Create container” Give your container a name. This can be anything you like, but it’s useful if it says something about the purpose of the container so you can tell your containers apart. You could name this container “Tutorials”, since you’ll be using it to access tutorials. In the “Compute Image” drop-down menu, select the “C-MOOR LearnR that your instructor chooses” Under “Data Volumes”, check the box next to “C-MOOR Data” Click “Create”. This may take a moment. You should now see a new entry in your list of containers “Created At” should be a few moments ago. “Name” should be the name you chose “Image” should be “C-MOOR LearnR” Start your C-MOOR LearnR container by clicking on its name (whatever name you chose when you created it). This will open in a new tab. You should see a list of tutorials, organized by topic. If instead you see an error message, you most likely forgot to check the box next to “C-MOOR Data” when you created the container. If you see something else, you may have picked the wrong “Compute Image” from the drop-down menu. If anything goes wrong, you can always delete your container by clicking the red “X” in the last column, and create a new container. 2.3.4.2.1 Resources sciserver.org Get help with SciServer on the C-MOOR Discourse 2.3.4.3 Complete your first LearnR tutorial If you’re not there already, go to the SciServer compute page and start up the C-MOOR LearnR container. Open sciserver.org in a web browser and log in to your account. If you are already logged in, click “Home” in the top menu to return to the home page. Scroll down to the second set of boxes and click “Compute”. Start your C-MOOR LearnR container by clicking on its name. Click on “Biological Databases”. The tutorial will open in a new tab. Complete the tutorial. 2.3.4.3.1 Resources sciserver.org Get help with SciServer on the C-MOOR Discourse 2.3.4.4 Delete your C-MOOR LearnR compute container Compute containers are meant to be temporary, and you can only have 3 containers total on SciServer. So it’s generally a good idea to clean up after yourself and delete your containers when you’re done using them. Also, if any updates are made to the C-MOOR LearnR container, you will need to create a new container to get the latest updates. Deleting your container will delete your progress in a tutorial, so don’t delete the container until you have completed the tutorial and submitted any required items to your instructor. To delete a container: If you’re not there already, go to the SciServer compute page. Open sciserver.org in a web browser and log in to your account. If you are already logged in, click “Home” in the top menu to return to the home page. Scroll down to the second set of boxes and click “Compute”. Find the container you want to delete.

We chose a poster as our final deliverable in C-MOOR because they: Facilitate participation in research symposiums: Students can use their poster to apply to present at research symposiums or conferences with minimal additional effort beyond what they do in class. If your institution does not have a research day, consider starting one using these posters as a foundation as we did at Clovis Community College! Your school’s library is another great point of contact in getting a poster session or research day set up. Some of the events students have participated in using their C-MOOR projects include: The Clovis Community College Research Day The Notre Dame of Maryland University Research Day The GRADS-4C Conference (2025) Serve as a physical representation of student achievement: If printed, once finished with the class, students can choose to take their poster with them or leave it with the class to be hung up around the classroom or the hallways. This gives their research project more visibility, serves as an advertisement for other students who might be interested in taking the class, and showcases what students have accomplished. Can easily be shared digitally: A presentation can’t be repeated twice without a recording, and each recording can take up a lot of digital storage. A poster on the other hand, is a great compressed product that can be posted on a student’s (or the institution’s) social media and help get their work seen by others. Posters are even small enough that they can be attached to an email and sent to prospective supervisors and collaborators interested in a quick summary of their work. See our Look at This! category on the C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum to see all the posters students have created and shared so far! Posters can be used to measure student achievement and understanding: We have previously used these posters to evaluate student learning, even years after students have left the classroom.

Poster is a powerful visual way to communicate new and exciting findings, share ideas and get feedback. No wonder Poster sessions are an integral part of any conference or symposium. Throughout research project work, students will work with their groups to put together a scientific research poster. 3.3.2 Part 1 - Choose a Template Estimated time: 5 minutes With your group, open a suggested poster template to use for your poster. Discuss with your group how you will divide up the work and exchange important information (e.g. phone numbers, email). Consider the following sections: Abstract Introduction Methods Results Conclusions/Discussion References Acknowledgments Not every poster has every section. Refer to your instructor and their rubric on what to include in your poster. Notice these posters are sized at 36 x 42 inches, but there are many other commonly used sizes. Refer to your instructor on what poster size to use; not every poster will fit every stand when printed (if applicable). Notice that the posters in this slidedeck come in two-column, three-column, and mixed formats. Think about your figures and tables and select a format that makes the most sense for them. There are also some example posters in the last two slides that we will use to examine the anatomy of a research poster further in the next part. 3.3.3 Part 2 - Make an Academic Research Poster Estimated time: — Complete the following components of your research poster with your group. You might not do them in this order, but these are the components you are being graded on. For more details on each of these sections and their role in a scientific paper, see the Scientific Literature Lab. 3.3.3.1 The header: title, authors, and affiliations Since you completed this work as a team of scientists, all of your team members are considered authors. List your team members in alphabetical order. The author’s affiliation is the university, college, research institution or company that the work was conducted at. An example affiliation for Clovis Community College would be: “Department of Biology, Clovis Community College, California, United States.” If multiple institutions exist, you will need to use superscript to denote who has what affiliation (see the example poster). We will include the C-MOOR logo, the logo of your institution(s), and the most immediately relevant funding source (if applicable) in the header. 3.3.3.2 Abstract C-MOOR Abstract examples: PacBio’s published abstract on ‘Genome-resolved metagenome assembly of human oral microbiome using highly accurate long-read sequencing’. An abstract is a concise summary of your research project from start to finish. An effective abstract will inform the reader of the relevant background to the research, the scientific hypothesis being tested, the purpose of the study, the main methods, and the most important results and conclusions. The abstract can be difficult to write because it combines all sections from your research and requires effective and concise communication of those sections. Many scientists choose to write the abstract last, after they fully understand the conclusions and implications of their work. Identify your scientific question, your hypothesis, and the knowledge gap (the unknown your research is addressing) first. Then brainstorm what you will need to tell your readers in terms of context and background. Your abstract should do the following: Include relevant background information such as*: - The model organism - The relevant phenotypes (ex. disease-state) - The gene of interest and its function - The known connection between the microbiome or gene and the phenotype - Relevant biological processes (ex. pathways) Clearly state hypothesis, aims, and/or objectives of the research: - e.g. Our hypothesis is that the healthy gut microbiome has more microbial diversity than the gut of an individual with a celiac disease.` - e.g. We hypothesize that maternal antibiotic treatment correlates with higher antibicrobial resistance in infant microbiome.` Briefly mention methodology you used in your research - e.g. Using Galaxy we analyzed the genomic diversity of the gut microbiome and compared fecal samples between individuals with Celiac Disease (CD) and a control group on a healthy diet without CD.` - e.g. We analyzed a publically available dataset comparing RNA-seq gene expression data between the left and right eyes in DESeq2.&quot; Summarize the main results of your study and how they relate to the hypothesis/aims/objectives you outlined earlier - e.g. We found that gene X was differentially abundant between the eye and all other tissues, suggesting gene X plays an important role in the eye. This may be important for learning more about eye development and X condition.` - e.g. We found an association between age and the presence of Y bacteria, which supports our hypothesis that Y bacteria is involved in the disease state` 3.3.3.3 Introduction Introductions can be highly variable. Sometimes they contain the same information as the abstract under a different name. At other times, the introduction only contains the relevant information needed to understand the study and the study’s hypothesis/aims/objectives and does not include the methodology, results, or takeaways from the study. In these cases, the introduction can go into more detail in comparision to an abstract. 3.3.3.4 Materials and Methods The materials and methods section will detail your analysis of the data. Don’t provide any of your results, just the methods. If you did not generate the data yourself from raw samples, you will simply cite the paper that made them instead of detailing their construction. We will also need to list any programs we used and provide credit to their creators. Some other things you might include would be what type of analysis you decided to do (which parts of the body parts you analyzed, sets of genes, what p-value you used, etc.). 3.3.3.5 Results The Results section is where you will detail your data primarily through figures and tables, though sometimes written text is included. Begin by creating your tables and figures. Figure body: Has high resolution images, well spaced and labeled parts and text. Place the figures and tables in order of how you want to present them and name them such as Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1, Table 2, etc. Figure/table Legends: Figures have their legends underneath them. Tables have their legends above them. The legend should be in a smaller font than the main text on the poster. A legend should includes a bolded figure title, which is a declarative statement that summarizes findings. A legend also includes figure text which a) identifies (and can briefly describe parts), b) includes brief description of of methods necessary to understand figure and c) should include relevant statistics (stats). Optional components: Bullet pointed text that summarizes the main findings of the figures/tables and references them (ex. We found result X (Fig 1)) A more informative section header which summarizes the main figure(s) instead of a generic “Results” header 3.3.3.6 Conclusions/Discussion The conclusion/discussion section of the paper is your chance to analyze and interpret your results. A discussion generally addresses the following: What do your results mean? How do they fit into the bigger picture? If any experiments did not give your expected results, hypothesize why that might have been the case and propose alternate experiments that could confirm or clarify your results Include at least one sentence of future work that you would do if you had more time or what students in upcoming semesters could do to continue to answer your questions 3.3.3.7 References All the references that you cite on your poster must be present in a References section including the following sections: Introduction, Methods, and Discussion. To save space on our posters, we will number our references (ex. 1-5) and use the numbers as citations throughout the text of your poster. You may have a lot of references; it is okay to put them in tiny text if you have to in order to make them fit. There are many different ways to format the reference section. We will make ours in alphabetical order by the first author’s last name. All of your sources must be scientific journals and should use the following format: Authors (year) “Title.” Journal Name, vol. #, page #s, DOI Online article that is also in print: Haussecker D., Huang Y., Lau A., Parameswaran P., Fire A. Z. and M. A. Kay (2010) “Human tRNA-derived small RNAs in the global regulation of RNA silencing.” RNA, Vol. 16, page 637-695, doi:10.1261/rna.2000810 Online article only: Marianes, A. and A. C. Spradling (2013) “Physiological and stem cell compartmentalization within the Drosophila midgut.” eLife, doi:10.7554/eLife.00886 3.3.3.8 Acknowledgements The acknowledgements section is where you give thanks to the people, organizations, and institutions that have supported you in your research. If relevant, include the grant ID # of your funding source. Institutions and organizations that have contributed to your research - but you do not belong to - can be thanked here. 3.3.4 Part 3 - Proofread and Add Final Touches Estimated time: 30 min to an hour Each group member should re-read the poster from beginning to end and fix any typos or grammatical errors. Check the alignment of figures, text boxes, titles, etc. Add some finishing touches. You can play with the color, the font, add additional images if it’s relevant. 3.3.5 Part 4 - Canvas Discussion Estimated time: 30 min You will turn in your poster to be graded as a group in a Canvas Assignment and post it to a Canvas Discussion to be viewed by the class. Convert your poster to a pdf. Have one member of your group turn in the pdf of your poster to the Graded Canvas Assignment. This assignment is already set up so that if one group member turns it in, it will show as submitted for all students in the group. This is where your instructor will grade you poster as a group. Have one member of your group post a pdf of your poster in the Canvas C-MOOR Poster Discussion. With your poster, introduce your group members and copy and paste your abstract into the post. Insert your pdf into the post and edit the link so that it automatically shows the inline preview. This will make it easier for students to view your poster. As an individual, read through the other posters from different groups. Post comments 3.3.6 Grading Criteria Your instructor will provide for you a rubric specific to your class. Refer to the rubric as your build your poster to make sure you have all the neccessary components. 3.3.7 Footnotes 3.3.7.1 Resources Generic rubric 3.3.7.2 Contributions and Affiliations Stephanie R.

We advise you and your students to do this as soon as possible after the end of class while your research project is still on your mind. 4.5.0.1 Resume or CV? You may hear the terms resume and CV being used interchangeably. While both are drawn from the same information, they vary in brevity and focus. A resume is a one-page (sometimes two-page) document of your experiences generally used for jobs outside of academia and research labs. It’s not uncommon for people to have more than one resume, as it’s best to tailor every resume to each specific role you’re applying to. A Curriculum Vitae (CV) is an extensive document that can take as many pages as needed to list the entirety of your research and academic experience. It often includes sections that aren’t found in non-academic fields such as publications, conferences, and published papers. Most positions will detail which they require from applicants and most colleges and universities will be able to help you build either at your library or career center. We suggest that current students and recent graduates interested add their C-MOOR research experience to either their classwork or projects section. Remember to acknowledge the contributions of your team members if applicable; this does not count against you in your applications! Here are some examples of how you might word your experiences; notice how they’re similar to an abstract in just one or two sentences: An RNA-seq project: Along with a partner, examined differential expression data of the period (per) gene along the Drosophila melanogaster midgut from a published dataset (Marianes &amp; Spradling 2013) using DESeq2 and ClusterProfiler. We discovered an elevated expression of per in the anterior region of the midgut where the primary digestion and absorption of carbohydrates occur. Our results were presented as a research poster at the 2025 Kuntz Research Day symposium and have implications for using Drosophila as a model for the connection between the circadian rhythm and metabolic disorders. A 16S project: My group and I profiled the abundance of Archean ASVs in the gut microbiome from a published 16S study comparing the gut microbiota of people before, during, and after a standardized diet (Guthrie et al. 2022). As a part of this study, we created a PCoA and performed an alpha diversity analysis in phyloseq. Archean community members are often overlooked in microbiome studies; we found differential abundance in Methanobacteria between male and female participants regardless of diet and hypothesize this may be due to consumption of fiber reported by male subjects pre- and post-diet. A WGS project: Public data (SRA#######) from Robinson et al. (2021) was analyzed in Galaxy using Trimmomatic, Megahit, and Krona to determine the viral abundance in samples from tap water from various North American Lakes and make comparisons to lake depth. Viral abundance was correlated with geographic distance between samples; future studies could examine if this pattern persists in samples sourced from Europe and Oceana. Your blurb is a strong blurb when:   You credit the source of your data (Citation, SRA #, Project #)   You describe why your research project matters   You list some of the computational platforms or software you used Q: Will people think I am an expert in genomics and bioinformatics if I put my project on my resume/CV? I don’t want to look like a phony. A: As a current student or new graduate, you are not expected to have mastery over any scientific domain. What you are trying to show is you have taken an idea and brought it to completion, your ability to learn new concepts and skills, and your previous exposure to research. You can explain more about your role in the project in an interview. Q: Can I list things like R or Galaxy in my skills section? A: You can, however we suggest being explicit in your experience and add the level at which you feel comfortable with each respective platform. Are you R (Beginner) or R (Proficient)? Can you teach someone else how to do your project? Can you perform your project with novel data? How good are you at troubleshooting? This answer may seem contrary to the previous one, but remember that other people who are listing these platforms in their skills section includes computer/data scientists (majors) and bioinformaticians (majors), so people may assume mastery. Think about it the same way you would a foreign language. Spanish (Beginner) describes a different level of skill than ‘just’ Spanish.

"],["pursue-further-research.html", "4.7 Pursue further research", " 4.7 Pursue further research Perhaps you’re interested in pursuing research beyond what C-MOOR currently provides. Maybe you’re more interested in wet lab work, or a specific model organism. We encourage you to try all sorts of different opportunities even if you feel totally comfortable working with C-MOOR so you can better understand what kind of roles suit you best. This section serves as a guide for some common jumping off points to find outside research opportunities. 4.7.1 Research opportunities at your institution Many colleges and universities have research programs for their students or resources available to connect you to some. You can ask your instructor, adviser, or library for more information. Some popular programs include: Undergraduate Research Opportunity Programs (UROP): Which often provide a database or pipeline of research opportunities for students at the univeristy or from surrounding areas. Research experiences for undergraduates (REU): Similar to UROP, but generally open for a wider audience of students from outside the community. See the NSF REU website for more information. Opportunities come and go and often follow the academic-year in terms of availability. If you can’t find something immediately, keep trying! 4.7.2 Find a research lab to join You can choose to pursue additional research opportunities in what we consider the more traditional way: by reaching out to a professor or research scientist whose work you are interested in and asking if they might be willing to have you in their lab. As these opportunities are at the discretion of the lab leader they will vary widely in their scope, duration, and ability to provide financial support. An email to a potential research lab should contain:  An introduction about yourself (name, class year, institution, major)  1-2 sentences about your previous experience in research  1-2 sentences about why you’re interested in their lab specifically  A polite, open ended request to work with them Dear Professor Penguin, My name is Student, and I am a junior at My University majoring in biology (or other). I read your chapter on the genetics yellow-eyed penguins in Penguins: Natural history and conservation, and then checked out your profile on the University website. My interests are broadly defined in environmental toxicology and I am interested in the work you are doing using eDNA and studies on the effects of plastic on developing penguin transcriptomes. I previously completed a project as a part of an RNA-seq miniCURE and have some exposure to working with DESeq2, though I still have much to learn. My group and I profiled the gene expression of the genes XYZ in the Drosophila midugt and I presented our poster at our university’s research day poster session. Thank you for your time and consideration in reading my email. Please let me know if you are currently available to mentor an undergraduate in your lab and if you would be willing to have me as a potential student. I hope to hear from you soon! Don’t be surprised if it takes the researcher a while to get back to you or if they respond curtly. They likely get many requests and are very busy. Continue to reach out to labs and apply to programs; it is difficult to know when opportunities are available as funding fluctuates.

What is BioDIGS?: BioDIGS is a project from the Genomic Data Science Community Network (GDSCN), which aims to characterize the microbiome of soil throughout sites in the US while connecting scientists to research. What makes BioDIGS different?: Soil is hypothesized to be the most diverse system on our planet, and BioDIGS is gathering sequence data and matching environmental data to elucidate the connection of soil microbes to abiotic variables and human health. Students at participating sites can take the entire project from soil sampling all the way through computational analysis.
