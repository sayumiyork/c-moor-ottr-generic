# Cloud platforms

Although you can technically run C-MOOR modules locally, we strongly recommend you use a cloud platform. The benefits of using the cloud platform:

1. Students do not have to go through a lengthy and complicated download and installation process
1. Students will use identical containers (computational environments) on the cloud environment, which prevents troubleshooting that might occur from differences in individual computers
1. It's far easier to keep with the most current version of our curriculum on a cloud platform that it does on local laptops; every time you load a container on the cloud any new updates will be pulled directly from our GitHub.

We have two different cloud platforms on which to run our modules, **SciServer** and **AnVIL**. Your choice will depend on a number of factors, such as the budget for your course and whether you will work with restricted-access datasets.

At this time, we are still piloting our modules on AnVIL. New instructors should read out to us as the [C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum](https://help.c-moor.org/c/help/) to determine which cloud platform is more appropriate for you and help get you access to our materials.
